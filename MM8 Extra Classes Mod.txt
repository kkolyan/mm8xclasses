# Description
This is a mod for Might and Magic VIII: Day of Destroyer, that adds few new playable characters to the game.
It was developed with attention to save original game balance.

# How to use
1. Install GOG version of Might and Magic VII: Day of Destroyer.
2. Install GrayFace patch: https://grayface.github.io/mm/#GrayFace-MM8-Patch (I used version 2.4.1)
3. Install MMExtension (I used v2.2).
    The easies way to do it is to download https://www.dropbox.com/s/qohxt8ijjh74mcw/MMExtensionTmp.rar?dl=1 and extract
    it to the game folder with replacement.
3. Extract this archive to the folder with game with replacement.
4. Play! Note that new characters aren't available to start game with. It's ok - you can change class of any character
    to new class by speaking with special teacher. All these teachers lives at the starting area (on a Dagger Wound Isle)

# Facts
- compatible with saves from non-modded game.
- should work with any localization, but new dialog options and class names will be in English.
- dragons can be converted to new classes too, but it doesn't worth it, because they loose firebreathing and do not gain ability to wear clothes.

# Details

## New classes

### Sorcerer
Very similar to Necromancer, but has Light Magic skill instead of Dark magic.
Can be promoted to Wizard.

### Druid
Very similar to Necromancer, but has Body, mind and Spirit Magic skills instead of Dark Magic.
Can be promoted to Great Druid.

# Justification of "class transformation" solution
I decided to not add new classes to the starting menu to avoid following problems.

### Problem with portraits:
- I could add new dedicated portraits for new classes, but I cannot draw them.
- I could use 4 portraits from MM7 or MM6, but there is no fair answer about which exactly. Also they style differs
    from the MM* style.
- I could choose 4 portraits from available for another classes, but it'll look weird to see the same portraits for another class in the
    character selection menu - player could even miss that it is another class. And there is still problem with fair
    choice of dedicated portraits. Also it is more complex than current solution.

### Problem with having more than one character of new class in party.
- I could add new hireable NPCs in game, but it is more complex than current solution. Also it adds mess with portrait selection.
