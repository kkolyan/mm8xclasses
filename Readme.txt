You can left click on the mini-map (lower right corner) or right click
on the player map (M key) in outdoor areas to get the name of the 
building the mouse cursor is over.

Mouse over on the mini-map will display the time, day, month and year.

Single click on the player map (M key) will allow the player to add
notes to the map.  

Right clicking on skills in the character screen will show which 
Skills the character can learn at his current promotion (white), skills 
he could potentially learn at a following promotion (yellow), and skills 
he will never be able to learn (red).  It will also show the total bonus 
to the skill from items.

Protection from Magic (master level Body spell) also protects against 
the Eradication condition at Grandmaster expertise.

Training takes one week per level per visit, to a maximum of the number 
of times any one single character trains.

Toggling colored lights (Video Options; hardware only) requires the 
Level to be reloaded to take effect.

The gamma setting can be changed in the Video Options submenu under 
the Controls option in the options menu (Esc command).  Note: Must 
be in full screen to affect the gamma setting (gamma correction is not
supported by all video cards).

The Reanimate spell will only be successful if the creatures' maximum 
hit points do not exceed the amount of hit points the caster is able 
to cast on the creature.  For example, a necromancer with two points of
Dark Magic skill will be able to reanimate a Pirate Wizard.  The same
necromancer will not be able to reanimate a Corsair because of its higher 
hit point total.

5)  Video Card And Other Hardware Drivers / DirectX

If you experience problems running Might and Magic VIII, make 
sure you have the latest drivers for your audio and video card. 
Video and Sound card manufacturers regularly update their software 
drivers to enhance performance and stability, and to improve 
compatibility with DirectX.  You can find links to many of these 
manufacturers' sites by going to the Driver Updates section of our 
support web site, which is located at http://www.3do.com/support. 

You may obtain a list of Microsoft-certified video and audio drivers for 
your hardware by going to http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest/hcl/.  Drivers 
listed here are confirmed to be compatibility with Windows 95, Windows 98
and Windows NT 4.0. 

Microsoft updates DirectX and its components regularly and posts them for
download off of their web site at http://www.microsoft.com/DirectX.  

Issues regarding the hardware acceleration.

The Voodoo2(TM) must have its latest DirectX 7 drivers.  The mouse 
cursor may experience flickering, but doesn't impact gameplay.  
If changing the gamma settings through the display properties, 
be sure to exit Might and Magic VIII first.

The Ticket To Ride(TM) has a choppy mouse on some machines.

Rendition Verite(TM) V2200 and the SIS6326 chipsets currently only run

The Intel740(TM) chipset based AGP graphics card on non-Intel motherboards

changing to the 'Microsoft Sound 3D hardware support' or disabling the 
Accelerated 3D Audio may resolve them.

software only.

3D Audio Only Available for Win9x.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

6)   Windows, Virtual Memory, and Hard Disk Space

The Windows operating system requires a certain amount of virtual 
memory to function properly. The amount of virtual memory required by 
Windows varies depending on how much of your computer's resources are 
required by an application.  Might and Magic VIII, like most 
other games, requires the use of most of your computer's resources to 
run properly.

Therefore, for a Windows application like Might and Magic VIII to 
run properly there must be sufficient free space on the hard disk with 
your Windows system folder.  You should keep enough free hard disk space 
equal to the larger of: two times the total amount of RAM your computer 
has; or, 10% of the space on the hard drive with Windows.

Note: Might and Magic VIII requires 375MB Megabytes (minimum) free 
hard drive space on the destination drive and at least 1 MB of free 
space on your C:\ drive.

8)   Troubleshooting

Installation 

Problem: 	
	The CD is in the CD-ROM drive, but the computer is not 
	recognizing it. 
Answers: 	
	The CD may be dirty or scratched.
Solutions: 	
	1. Make sure that the data side of the CD (shiny side) is not 
	dirty or scratched.  If it is dirty, take a lint free 
	non-abrasive cloth and wipe gently to clean it (always wipe from 
	the inside of the CD to the outside edges).  If the data side of 
	the CD appears to be scratched, return the game to the store that
	you bought it from, and exchange it for a new copy. If you are 
	unable to exchange the game at the store that you bought it from,
	please call Customer Support for information on our exchange 
	policy.

Problem:	
	The computer freezes during install, or you receive an error 
	message (such as "*_ins error" or "An error has occurred during 
	the move data process") during install.
Answers: 	
	Your computer may be using an older 16-bit CD-ROM driver; or 
	there may not be enough space on your hard drive for temporary 
	files to expand; or the CD-ROM drive might be having problems 
	with how it buffers information. Or, the Autorun or DMA settings 
	on your CD-ROM drive could be interfering with the game 
	installation.

To check and see if your computer is using an older 16-bit CD-ROM driver:
	1. Right-click on the 'My Computer' icon and select 'Properties'.
	2. Click on the 'Performance' tab.
	3. In the Performance status box, if the File System line says  
	"Some drivers are using MS-DOS compatibility", you are using a 
	16-bit CD-ROM driver.
Solutions:	
	1. For 16-bit CD-ROM drivers: Contact the manufacturer of your 
	CD-ROM drive or the manufacturer of your computer for an updated
	32-bit CD-ROM driver.

	2. For 32-bit CD-ROM drivers:
		1. Close all unnecessary programs running in the 
		Background.  Press the CTRL+ALT+DEL keys at the same time
		to open the Close Program window, select a program, and 
		press the End Task button.  Repeat this process until all
		programs except 'Explorer' and 'Systray' are closed.
	
		2. Delete all files in your C:\Windows\Temp folder, then 
		empty the Recycle Bin.

	3. Turn off read-ahead on the CD-ROM drive:
		1. Right-click on the 'My Computer' icon and select 
		   'Properties'.
		2. Click on the 'Performance' tab.
		3. Click on the 'File System' button.
		4. Choose the 'CD-ROM' tab at the top
		5. Change the 'Optimize access pattern for' field to 
		   'No read-ahead'
		6. Click on Apply, then OK and finally click Close (you 
		   will be prompted to restart your system).

	4. Turn off the Autorun and DMA settings on your CD-ROM drive:
		1. Right click on the 'My Computer' icon and choose 
		   'Properties'.
		2. Click on the 'Device Manager' tab.
		3. Click on the '+' sign next to the CD-ROM line so that 
		   it becomes a '-' sign.
		4. Click on the line that appears under the CD-ROM line 
		   so that it is highlighted, then click on the 
		   'Properties' button.
		5. Click on the 'Settings' tab.
		6. Look for the Auto-insert Notification and DMA lines.  
		   If there is a check mark in the boxes next to either 
		   of these lines, click on the box to remove the check 
		   mark.
		7. Click on the 'Apply' button, and then click on the 
		   'OK' button.
		8. When you are asked if you want to restart your system,
		   choose 'Yes'.
